  abstract  = {The Complete Guide to OpenACC for Massively Parallel Programming Scientists and technical professionals can use OpenACC to leverage the immense power of modern GPUs without the complexity traditionally associated with programming them. OpenACC for Programmers is one of the first comprehensive and practical overviews of OpenACC for massively parallel programming. This book integrates contributions from 19 leading parallel-programming experts from academia, public research organizations, and industry. The authors and editors explain each key concept behind OpenACC, demonstrate how to use essential OpenACC development tools, and thoroughly explore each OpenACC feature set. Throughout, youll find realistic examples, hands-on exercises, and case studies showcasing the efficient use of OpenACC language constructs. Youll discover how OpenACCs language constructs can be translated to maximize application performance, and how its standard interface can target multiple platforms via widely used programming languages. Each chapter builds on what youve already learned, helping you build practical mastery one step at a time, whether youre a GPU programmer, scientist, engineer, or student. All example code and exercise solutions are available for download at GitHub. Discover how OpenACC makes scalable parallel programming easier and more practical Walk through the OpenACC spec and learn how OpenACC directive syntax is structured Get productive with OpenACC code editors, compilers, debuggers, and performance analysis tools Build your first real-world OpenACC programs Exploit loop-level parallelism in OpenACC, understand the levels of parallelism available, and maximize accuracy or performance Learn how OpenACC programs are compiled Master OpenACC programming best practices Overcome common performance, portability, and interoperability challenges Efficiently distribute tasks across multiple processors Register your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

  abstract  = {Parallel Programming with OpenACC is a modern, practical guide to implementing dependable computing systems. The book explains how anyone can use OpenACC to quickly ramp-up application performance using high-level code directives called pragmas. The OpenACC directive-based programming model is designed to provide a simple, yet powerful, approach to accelerators without significant programming effort. Author Rob Farber, working with a team of expert contributors, demonstrates how to turn existing applications into portable GPU accelerated programs that demonstrate immediate speedups. The book also helps users get the most from the latest NVIDIA and AMD GPU plus multicore CPU architectures (and soon for Intel Xeon Phi as well). Downloadable example codes provide hands-on OpenACC experience for common problems in scientific, commercial, big-data, and real-time systems. Topics include writing reusable code, asynchronous capabilities, using libraries, multicore clusters, and much more. Each chapter explains how a specific aspect of OpenACC technology fits, how it works, and the pitfalls to avoid. Throughout, the book demonstrates how the use of simple working examples that can be adapted to solve application needs. Presents the simplest way to leverage GPUs to achieve application speedups Shows how OpenACC works, including working examples that can be adapted for application needs Allows readers to download source code and slides from the book's companion web page}
